INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES APPLIED TO MAIN BRANCH
================================================

This file documents the infrastructure improvements applied to the main branch
from the Portfolio branch. These are pure template enhancements with no impact
on existing projects.

CHANGES SUMMARY
==============

1. MATH SUPPORT (MathJax)
   - Added MathJax CDN in _layouts/default.html
   - Support for inline ($E=mc^2$) and display ($$...$$) math
   - Automatic LaTeX rendering on all pages

2. INTERACTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION (Plotly.js)
   - Added Plotly library to default layout
   - New include files:
     * _includes/interactive-plot.html - Single plot with CSV loading
     * _includes/universal-plot-handler.html - Multi-plot support
     * _includes/servos-plots.html - Example specialized plots
     * _includes/debug-plot-config.html - Configuration debugger
   - Configurable CSV data inclusion in _config.yml

3. GALLERY & MEDIA IMPROVEMENTS
   - Auto-detection of media type (video/image) by file extension
   - Optional media captions support
   - Fixed aspect ratio preservation (object-fit: contain)
   - Improved responsive design for mobile devices
   - Updated CSS in _sass/_project.scss and _sass/_responsive.scss

4. PROJECT LISTING ENHANCEMENTS
   - Sorted projects by date (newest first) on index.md
   - Same sorting applied to projects.md
   - Creates consistent chronological ordering

===========================

Configuration:
  _config.yml - Added CSV files to build include

Layout Files:
  _layouts/default.html - MathJax + Plotly.js

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
====================

All changes are fully backward compatible:
- Existing projects display correctly without modification
- Old gallery format (with explicit type) still works
- Projects without date field still appear (sorted last)
- Mathematical content is optional
- Plot configuration is optional

NEXT STEPS
=========

1. Verify all changes applied correctly
2. Run: jekyll build or jekyll serve
3. Test math rendering on a test page
4. Test plot loading with sample CSV files
5. Verify responsive design on mobile
6. Commit changes to main branch
