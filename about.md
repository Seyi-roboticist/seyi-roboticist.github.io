# About Me

I came to robotics through an unconventional path. After immigrating to Canada with limited resources, I worked for years as an Aviation Systems Technician — maintaining and operating high-stakes systems where reliability is non-negotiable. That experience built a lasting respect for robust design, fault tolerance, and engineering that performs under real-world pressure.

At Johns Hopkins University, I earned the LCSR Distinguished Scholarship and focused on controls, perception, autonomy, and machine learning. I contributed to underwater vehicle control systems under IEEE Fellow Prof. Louis Whitcomb, led the Aurelia autonomous UAV project (full ROS 2 stack, sim-to-real deployment, highest course score in program history), and served as a graduate teaching assistant for three robotics courses, mentoring over 800 students.

Today, I work as a Controls Engineer at The RDI Group, developing safety-critical industrial automation systems with Allen-Bradley PLCs, deterministic real-time sequences, and fault-tolerant architectures for continuous production environments. While this hones my ability to deliver robust, production-grade solutions, my deepest expertise and passion remain in precision motion control, state estimation, computer vision, sensor fusion, and autonomous systems — particularly for dynamic, safety-critical applications like UAVs.
