# About

Controls and autonomy engineer focused on flight dynamics, state estimation, and real-time systems. I work across the full pipeline — from first-principles dynamic modeling and controller design through hardware deployment and flight testing.

My technical foundation spans fixed-wing and rotary-wing UAV control, sensor fusion in GPS-denied environments, precision motion control on industrial hardware, and safety-critical automation systems that run 24/7 in production.

I hold dual pilot certifications (FAA Part 107, Transport Canada Advanced) and have hands-on experience with aircraft systems from years as an Aviation Systems Technician — not just the math, but the hardware.
