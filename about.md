# About Me

I entered robotics through an unconventional route. After immigrating to Canada with limited resources, I spent years as an Aviation Systems Technician — maintaining and operating high-stakes aviation systems where reliability is non-negotiable. That hands-on experience built a deep respect for robust design, fault tolerance, and engineering that must perform under real-world pressure.

At Johns Hopkins University, I earned the LCSR Distinguished Scholarship and focused on controls, perception, autonomy, and machine learning. I contributed to underwater vehicle control systems under IEEE Fellow Prof. Louis Whitcomb, led the Aurelia autonomous UAV project (full ROS 2 autonomy stack, sim-to-real deployment, highest course score in program history), and served as a graduate teaching assistant for three robotics courses, mentoring over 800 students.

Today, I work as a Controls Engineer at The RDI Group, designing safety-critical industrial automation systems with Allen-Bradley PLCs, deterministic real-time sequences, and fault-tolerant architectures for continuous production environments. While this sharpens my production-grade robustness, my core expertise and passion remain in precision motion control, state estimation, computer vision, sensor fusion, deep learning, and autonomous systems — especially for dynamic, safety-critical applications such as UAVs.
